## Project Overview

This repository is a collection of two image classification projects, demonstrating how CNNs can effectively extract features and classify images:

1. **Fashion MNIST Classification**: Classifies images from the Fashion MNIST dataset into 10 categories, such as T-shirts, trousers, dresses, etc.
2. **Fruit Classification and Deployment**: Classifies images of apples, bananas, and oranges using a custom dataset. The model is converted into a TensorFlow Lite format for deployment on mobile and edge devices.

Both projects emphasize modularity, robust architecture, and scalability for various classification tasks.
