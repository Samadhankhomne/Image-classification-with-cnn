# Image Classification with CNNs

This repository demonstrates the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification tasks. It covers the entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment using TensorFlow Lite for edge-device compatibility.

---

## Project Overview

This project focuses on building robust CNN models for two distinct image classification tasks:

1. **Fashion MNIST Dataset**:  
   A standard dataset of grayscale images representing 10 different categories of clothing (e.g., T-shirts, trousers, sneakers). The model demonstrates preprocessing, training, and evaluation techniques on this popular benchmark dataset.

2. **Fruits Dataset**:  
   A custom dataset of colored images representing three fruit classes: apples, bananas, and oranges. This task emphasizes dataset preparation, visualization, and training with a focus on converting the model to TensorFlow Lite for efficient deployment on mobile or edge devices.

Both tasks showcase end-to-end workflows, making this repository an excellent learning resource for understanding CNNs in action. The project is designed to be modular and extendable for other datasets.
